# Waitlist Feature

Captures signups from two distinct audiences who want PowVal when it launches:

- **Consumers** — skiers who want to buy or sell their own gear (hero + main form).
- **Ski shops** — retailers who want bulk trade-in/inventory pricing ("For ski shops" band).

The two audiences are stored in **separate collections** so demand can be measured independently.

---

## User flow

1. User visits `/` (the landing page).
2. Three Vue forms render, all from the same `WaitlistForm` component:
   - The hero inline form (`#hero-form`, `variant: 'inline'`) — **email** only, single-row capture above the fold. Until Vue mounts (or if the CDN fails), the container holds a plain "Get early access" link to `#join` as a fallback.
   - The consumer form (`#waitlist-app`) — **email** only.
   - The shop form (`#shop-app`, `audience: 'shop'`) — **shop name** + **work email**.
3. Vue handles client-side validation and submits to `POST /waitlist` via `fetch`, including a `type` field.
4. On success the form is replaced by a confirmation message (announced via `role="status"` for screen readers). A repeat signup is also treated as success — the confirmation acknowledges "you're already on the list" instead of showing an error. A "Wrong email? Re-enter it" button on the confirmation returns to the form (email preserved, input focused) so typos can be corrected.
5. On validation error (invalid email, missing shop name) an inline error message is shown without a page reload, with the failing input highlighted and wired up via `aria-invalid` / `aria-describedby`.

## API contract

### `POST /waitlist`

**Request body** (JSON):

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "Ada Lovelace",
  "type": "consumer",
  "shopName": "Powder House Skis"
}
```

- `email` — required, validated, max 254 chars.
- `type` — `"consumer"` (default) or `"shop"`. Routes the signup to the matching collection.
- `name` — optional (consumer), capped at 80 chars.
- `shopName` — required when `type` is `"shop"` (capped at 120 chars), ignored otherwise.
- `hp` — honeypot. A hidden field humans never fill. If non-empty, the request is treated as a bot: the API returns `{ ok: true }` but **nothing is stored**, keeping demand data clean.

Non-string values for any field are coerced to `''` before validation, so malformed JSON bodies produce a 422, never a 500.

**Success — 201 Created:**
```json
{ "ok": true }
```

**Already on the list — 200 OK** (treated as success, not an error — the user's goal is already met; nothing is re-stored):
```json
{ "ok": true, "duplicate": true }
```

**Validation error — 422 Unprocessable Entity:**
```json
{ "ok": false, "error": "Invalid email address." }
```
```json
{ "ok": false, "error": "Shop name is required." }
```

**Rate limited — 429 Too Many Requests:**
```json
{ "ok": false, "error": "Too many requests. Please try again in a minute." }
```

Duplicates are checked **per collection** — the same email may exist once on the consumer list and once on the shop list.

`POST /waitlist` is rate limited to **8 requests per minute per IP** (in-memory, set in `server.js`). Combined with the honeypot, this keeps automated signups from polluting the demand data.

## Storage format

Signups are persisted in **SQLite** (`data/powval.db`, WAL mode, via `better-sqlite3`)
behind the same `lib/storage.js` `read(collection)` / `write(collection, data)`
interface the JSON files used — the swap touched no service code.

Two tables, one per collection:

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `waitlist` | `email`, `name`, `createdAt` |
| `shops` | `email`, `name`, `shopName`, `createdAt` |

On first startup after the migration, any legacy `data/waitlist.json` / `data/shops.json`
rows are imported once and the files renamed to `*.json.imported` (kept as a manual
rollback, never deleted). The DB and imported files are gitignored.

Inspect signups directly:

```bash
sqlite3 data/powval.db 'SELECT * FROM waitlist'
```

In production the DB is backed up nightly with 14-day rotation (see
[deployment.md](./deployment.md)).

## Module map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `routes/waitlist.js` | Thin route handler — reads `req.body`, calls service, sends `res` |
| `services/waitlist.js` | Validates input, routes to the consumer/shop collection, checks duplicates, writes via storage |
| `lib/storage.js` | Generic per-collection read/write interface (`waitlist`, `shops`) |
| `views/index.ejs` | Landing page shell; mounts all three Vue form instances |
| `public/js/components/WaitlistForm.js` | Vue component — `audience` prop drives fields/copy, `variant: 'inline'` renders the compact hero layout; form state, validation, fetch, success/error UI |
