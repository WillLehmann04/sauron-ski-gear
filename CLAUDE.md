# CLAUDE.md — What's My Gear Worth?

## Self-maintenance rule

**Documentation is part of "done," not an afterthought.** After any significant change — new feature, refactor, new module, changed command — update this file and the relevant doc in `docs/` in the same change. If a PR adds a route, `docs/` gets an update. If a script is added to `package.json`, the Run/Dev Commands section below gets an update.

## Commit and push rule

**After every feature is implemented and the user confirms they're happy with it, commit and push the changes.** This means: once the user signs off ("looks good", "ship it", "that's right", or equivalent confirmation), stage all related changes, write a descriptive commit message, and push to `main`. Do not wait to be asked — confirmation is the trigger.

## Project overview

**What's My Gear Worth?** is a web tool that estimates the resale value of used ski and snowboard gear. Users enter their gear details and get an instant estimate. A waitlist captures people who want to buy or sell gear through the platform when it launches.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js |
| Server | Express |
| Templating | EJS (server-rendered pages + partials + layouts) |
| Client interactivity | Vue 3 (CDN, mounted into EJS pages) |
| Storage | JSON file (behind a swappable interface) |
| Config | `.env` via `dotenv` |

Keep other choices simple and swappable. Add dependencies deliberately.

**What belongs where:**

- **`routes/`** — Express router files. Each file owns one resource. Handlers read `req`, call a service, and send `res`. No logic beyond that.
- **`services/`** — All business logic. Validate input, enforce rules (dedup, formatting), call `lib/` for storage. Must not know about `req`/`res`.
- **`lib/`** — Pure utilities and thin interfaces. `storage.js` exposes `read(collection)` / `write(collection, data)` so the backing store can be swapped.
- **`views/`** — EJS only. Layouts wrap pages; partials are reused fragments. No business logic in templates.
- **`public/`** — Static assets served as-is. Vue components live here as ES modules (no build step required for now).
- **`data/`** — Runtime data files (e.g. `waitlist.json`). Add to `.gitignore` if sensitive; keep a `.gitkeep` to preserve the directory.
- **`docs/`** — One Markdown file per feature/module. `docs/README.md` is the index. Keep in sync with code.

## Coding conventions

### DRY / reuse
No copy-pasted logic. Shared logic goes in `services/` or `lib/`; shared UI goes in EJS partials or reusable Vue components. Prefer composing small, focused functions.

### Single responsibility
Each module does one thing. Routes route. Services validate and orchestrate. Storage reads and writes. Keep files small and names obvious.

### Naming
- Files and directories: `kebab-case`
- JS variables and functions: `camelCase`
- Vue components: `PascalCase`
- EJS partials: `kebab-case.ejs`

### Separation of concerns
Routes are thin — they translate HTTP to function calls and back. Business logic lives in `services/`. Data access is isolated in `lib/storage.js` so the backing store can change without touching service code.

### Input validation
Validate all external input at the route boundary (using the service). Return explicit, descriptive errors. Never trust `req.body` without checking it.

### Error handling
Handle errors explicitly — no silent swallows. Services throw or return `{ ok: false, error }`. Routes translate that to HTTP status codes.

### Config and secrets
All config and secrets via `.env` loaded by `dotenv`. Never hardcode values. Commit `.env.example` with placeholder values. `.gitignore` must include `.env` and `data/*.json` if the data is sensitive.

## Documentation rules

- Every feature and significant module gets a doc in `docs/`.
- `docs/README.md` is the index — link every doc from it.
- Docs describe the *what* and *why*, not the code line-by-line.
- Update docs in the same commit as the code change.

## Run / dev commands

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run dev          # start server with nodemon (auto-reload)
npm start            # start server (production)
```

> Update this section whenever scripts change in `package.json`.
